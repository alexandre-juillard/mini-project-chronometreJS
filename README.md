This project is my first ever Javascript project to train and learn new functions I have seen during JS lessons. Click on Go button = start count every seconds. Click on Stop button= stop counting until click again on Go. Click on Reset button = restart a new count from 0. Style is made with CSS file.
I never learnt code before this lesson (2 weeks lessons).
Thanks for reading
